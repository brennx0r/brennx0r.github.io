As it turns out, I had forgotten the setup/layout for the Gatsby starter I was using, so updating it was very difficult. I ended up scrapping the whole thing for another starter template which is much simpler, easier to read and extend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other woes I ran into had to deal with the npm module &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt;, caching and deployment. In trying to deploy to repo &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;brennx0r.github.io&lt;/code&gt;, master branch - I kept getting this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bash
fatal: A branch named â€˜masterâ€™ already exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
npm ERR! errno 1
npm ERR! gatsby-starter-blog@1.0.0 deploy: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby build &amp;amp;&amp;amp; gh-pages -d public -b &amp;gt; master -r git@github.com:brennx0r/brennx0r.github.io.git&lt;/code&gt;
npm ERR! Exit status 1
npm ERR! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After scouring a number of sites (and frustratingly getting the â€˜answerâ€™ of referring back to the Gatsby reference material which does not explain how to fix the problem), I was finally able to see some documentation via the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; readme about a potential solution which ended up resolving it for me:  Clearing the cache for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;node_modules/gh-pages/.cache&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing along this information to folks who may also be looking for a fix. ðŸ’œ âœ¨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing the migration was a whole lot more straightforward than I thought it would be. What made the ease of migration possible was mainly due to the existance of modules, starters, and excellent documentation to help with getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m very excited to begin my journey in working more actively with the JavaScript ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having been rooted in the Ruby community for several years, itâ€™s an interesting change of pace to take a peek into what other communities are doing, what the development patterns are, and how folks interact with eachother.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
