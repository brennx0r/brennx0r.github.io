If you prep the sauce ahead of time, assembly and oven time is about 40 minutes.</p>\n<p>Makes 4 generous servings.</p>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2 TBSP olive oil</li>\n<li>1/2 lb ground lamb (I used the lamb patties available at CostCo)</li>\n<li>1 cup of diced carrots</li>\n<li>1 28 oz can of diced tomatoes (I prefer Muir Glen - make sure to read the ingredient list as some makers will sneak in high fodmap spices)</li>\n<li>1/2 cup red wine</li>\n<li>1 TBSP fresh basil, chopped</li>\n<li>1 TBSP fresh oregano, chopped</li>\n<li>1 package gluten-free, oven-ready lasagna noodles</li>\n<li>1 egg</li>\n<li>1 16 oz package ricotta</li>\n<li>2 TBSP fresh parley, chopped</li>\n<li>1 package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>\n<li>salt and pepper</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Hardware</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A dutch oven or large enameled pot with a lid</li>\n<li>A large mixing bowl</li>\n<li>A ladle</li>\n<li>a 9‚Äùx 9‚Äù deep dish pan (with lid if possible. If not lid, use aluminum foil.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Method</h3>\n<h4>Assemble the ricotta mix.</h4>\n<p>Using the large bowl, add one egg and whisk. Add the whole package of ricotta, 2 TBSPs parsley, 1TSP each salt and pepper to the bowl and mix well. Set aside.</p>\n<h4>Make the sauce.</h4>\n<p>To the crock pot: On medium-high heat, add the olive oil and the ground lamb. Cook until brown. Add the carrots and saut√© for a few minutes until glossy. Add diced tomato, fresh herbs (oregano and basil), red wine, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, then turn to simmer. Let simmer around 30 minutes so the ingredients get to know one another and become friends. Taste the sauce and adjust seasonings how you like them.  At this time, you should start the pre-heating of your oven @ 400‚ÄôF.</p>\n<h4>Assemble the lasagna.</h4>\n<p>Gather together:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sauce</li>\n<li>Noodles</li>\n<li>Mozz</li>\n<li>Ricotta mix</li>\n<li>Deep Dish pan</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now‚Äôs the fun bit:  Make the stack.</p>\n<p>For the layers in the pan, go in this order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tiny bit of sauce (to prevent sticking to the bottom of the pan)</li>\n<li>Noodles</li>\n<li>Ricotta</li>\n<li>Mozz</li>\n<li>Sauce</li>\n<li>Noodles</li>\n<li>Ricotta</li>\n<li>Mozz</li>\n<li>Sauce</li>\n<li>Noodles</li>\n<li>Sauce</li>\n<li>Mozz</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cover the lasagna with the dish lid or aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes covered, followed by 20 minutes uncovered.</p>\n<p>Take out of the oven and allow to cool for at least 10 minutes to prevent LavaMouth(tm).
