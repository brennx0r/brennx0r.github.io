As it turns out, I had forgotten the setup/layout for the Gatsby starter I was using, so updating it was very difficult. I ended up scrapping the whole thing for another starter template which is much simpler, easier to read and extend.</p>\n<p>Other woes I ran into had to deal with the npm module <code class=\"language-text\">gh-pages</code>, caching and deployment. In trying to deploy to repo <code class=\"language-text\">brennx0r.github.io</code>, master branch - I kept getting this error:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>bash\nfatal: A branch named â€˜masterâ€™ already exists.</p>\n<p>npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE\nnpm ERR! errno 1\nnpm ERR! gatsby-starter-blog@1.0.0 deploy: <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby build &amp;&amp; gh-pages -d public -b &gt; master -r git@github.com:brennx0r/brennx0r.github.io.git</code>\nnpm ERR!
