Let‚Äôs chat!</p>\n<h2><a id=\"Where\">üåé Where</a></h2>\n<p>I live in Seattle, WA. I am exclusively looking to join remote / distributed-first organizations.  </p>\n<p>While I am open to work travel once the COVID-19 pandemic is over, at this current time I will not be open to travel. Alternatively, I am happy to attend any organizational events remotely.</p>\n<p>I deeply miss collaborating with colleagues in in-person settings (summits, off-site events, etc.), and I am looking forward to a future where it is safe to return to this type of collaboration.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"About-Me\">üë©üèª‚Äçüé§ About Me</a></h2>\n<p>If you are looking for high-level information about my professional experience, please refer to <a href=\"/brenna-flood-resume-eba585b180a362f5be6de20af6014d04.pdf\">my resume</a> or <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brennaflood\" target=new>LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been in tech industry for over 20 years, beginning with an entry-level support role, learning as I progressed over a landscape of different interests, mastering each and moving towards my passions: Technical Support, Systems Engineering, Software Quality Assurance, Build and Release Engineering, and Production Engineering / SRE. Everything I‚Äôve learned about the industry - technologies, processes, and procedures - has all been self-taught: Exploration through reading, attending conferences, hands-on learning, talking to field experts, and attending specific trainings.</p>\n<p>I am highly organized, I love building helpful, concise documentation focused on engagement and learning. I care about outcomes. I optimize towards thoughtfulness, then action: Move deliberately and fix things. </p>\n<p>I care very deeply about people, and believe that treating folks with kindness and respect in the workplace should have, at a minimum, equal care and weight as OKRs, KPIs, or other business objectives, as it‚Äôs <strong>people</strong> that complete those business objectives. Hiring is expensive. Teams are immutable. Focus and psychological safety are important to the health of any business.</p>\n<p>I can tell you many tales about wide changes (configuration management, virtualization,emerging technologies, etc.) I‚Äôve seen in the industry over my career, and (probably) why the changes happened. I can tell you all about all the times/ways I‚Äôve broken production, or worked through the pain of multi-hour production deployments, or have reduced cycle time from months to days to hours to minutes, and why those time scales have massive impacts for organizations. I can tell you all about the amazing, smart, incredible people I‚Äôve had the distinct honor and privilege to work with. I can tell you about that one time I made 10+ muppet-style puppets to put on a show with two of my favorite people to send a love letter to our favorite conference talks for one of my favorite programming languages. </p>\n<h2><a id=\"what-im-looking-for\">üîé What I‚Äôm looking for</a></h2>\n<p>In my next adventure, I am looking for an organization that cares about and has active care and discussion surrounding:</p>\n<p>üë• <strong>People.</strong> What things are the company doing in regards to employee support in your company? What do you value in the interviewing experience? Offer? Pay and Benefits? Career progression and learning? What practices and procedures do you have in support of DEI and healthy cultures? Where is the company making investments? No company has everything figured out - but there‚Äôs a difference in companies who care and actively reflect on how to evolve and strengthen values surrounding employee care, and those who don‚Äôt prioritize people. I prefer to be a part of businesses who make big bets on their people.</p>\n<p>üß± <strong>Sustainability</strong>. Is there a clear picture about how decisions are made at the company? If not entirely clear, what discussions, forums, actions are happening to gain better clarity? Is roadmapping discussion unidirectional or bi-directional? What is the burn rate? What is the runway? As a manager, what tools do I have at the ready to engage and collaborate with folks to ensure business objectives are met?</p>\n<p>üìú <strong>Clear, Moral Mission and Values</strong>. There are many challenges we face - especially in the past couple years. With the increased intensity of climate change, societal change, I believe that it‚Äôs important now - more than ever - to devote time and attention to a company mission that is clearly defined and specifically supports a net-positive good for communities around the world, whether it be in direct support of clean technology, providing equity to communities without access, technology that makes people happier and healthier. Beyond this, what forums or communication loops does the company have to encourage discussion about what moral or ethical implications surrounding the things we are building?</p>\n<p>üí∞ <strong>Level and Compensation</strong>. Commensurate with my level of technical leadership and management experience, level and pay aligned with M2 described in many tech organizations for the Seattle area <a href=\"https://www.levels.fyi/comp.html?track=Software%20Engineering%20Manager&search=M2&region=819&yoestart=5&yoeend=10&yoeradio=Senior%20Level&workarrangement=Remote\" target=new>(levels.fyi)</a> is appropriate.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"location\">üèô Location</a></h3>\n<p>It doesn‚Äôt matter much to me where the company HQ is, as long as the People team can support US, Bermuda, or Canada-based employees (taxes, benefits, etc.) as I am potentially moving later this year or early next year.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"working-hours\">üéπ Working Hours </a></h3>\n<p>My preferred working hours are between 9AM - 5PM Pacific, with room for flexibility to tend to the normal day-to-day things: Have lunch, get exercise, or step away for a walk to reflect so that I can make the best, forward-thinking, creative solutions in support of my colleagues. </p>\n<h3><a id=\"size\">üéö Size</a></h3>\n<p>My ideal organization size is between <strong>50 and 250 employees, where I am managing 6 - 15 people (managing ICs or managing managers)</strong>. I am very comfortable managing at this level and will remain happy managing at this level for the forseeable future.</p>\n<p>If this company size doesn‚Äôt fit your org, I may still be open to speaking with you about roles if you are in a place where there‚Äôs sprawl and complexity, you have identified at an org level that change is needed, and you intend to hire someone with the budget and latitude to make changes happen. I have a proven track record across my career to be able not only evaluate areas of change, but also fulfilling the commitment of making changes happen in support of reduced technical complexity and tool cost reduction (while documenting and standardizing along the way).</p>\n<center>\n<p><img src=\"/i-love-mess-32e344afd75213be1b8dfea84943f193.gif\" alt=\"I love mess.\"></p>\n</center>\n<h3><a id=\"type-of-work\">Type of Work</a></h3>\n<p>I am interested in managing a SDET, QA, CI/CD, Infra, Release, Platform, or DevOps team/organization. I‚Äôve managed single teams (4-6 FTE) and I have also managed multiple teams with entirely different functions simulateously (4-6 FTE; 2-3 contractors). While I feel comfortable doing both, I prefer to manage a single time when joining an organization to ensure I have time to learn as much as I can about the company, setup, people, etc. before branching out in responsibility.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"culture\">Culture</a></h3>\n<p>People: Smart, Kind, Growth Mindset, and open to change\nBusiness Communications: Opportunities for bi-directional feedback across the business.\nLeadership and Feedback: A genuine interest in getting candid, kind feedback.
