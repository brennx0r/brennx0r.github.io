Specifically, London, then Scotland, then back to London. </p>\n<p>The idea for the trip was kicked off when reflecting upon going to Maui for my birthday last year. It was an incredible experience, and I wanted to be able to reciprocate for Jer by taking him to the top locations on his ‚Äúbucket list‚Äù.</p>\n<p>Various folks on Twitter have requested that I create a blog post which discusses the process I use to plan a trip. I hope you find the below information useful. </p>\n<h2>So now that there‚Äôs a location in mind, how the heck to begin planning? ü§î</h2>\n<h3>Collaboration Tools Make It Happen!</h3>\n<p>If you are planning a trip with anyone, you‚Äôre gonna need a collaboration tool which you can collectively reference what needs to be planned, what‚Äôs already been considered and booked, as well as a common reference place for information - hotel names and addresses, booking reference numbers, etc.</p>\n<p>These tools can look anything like the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keybase</li>\n<li>Google Drive</li>\n<li>Git(hu|la)b</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these can be fine choices, but the important bit is that everyone involved in the planning should enjoy using the tool, and the tool should have some security-mindedness (ACLs, etc.) so that if you opt to include sensitive information, this information is kept safe.</p>\n<p>Below I‚Äôll go through the detail concerning all the bits and bobs I find to be handy in this common collaboration space.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>For Jer and me, doing touristy stuff doesn‚Äôt rank highly on the list (if at all), so we don‚Äôt need to manage every hour of the day with markers of all those little events.</p>\n<p>That said, it still makes sense when planning a trip (especially one with with multiple locations involved) to have a timeline of events at easy reach. Even if you think you may have a ‚Äúsimple trip‚Äù, having a timeline will help tease all sorts of shapes/sizes of logistics to consider and resolve: Timings between the transportation, flights, hotel, meals. </p>\n<p>Through the creation of your own timeline you may realize that by booking that morning flight that you have cheated yourself out of a decent breakfast at the hotel because the times are out of band. You may be arriving so late in the evening that unless you call the hotel and schedule a late-checkin ahead of time, no one will be available to give you a room key. While doing this will take a bit of time up-front, this will ultimately save you the time, anxiety, and headache of having to deal with the fallout of a poorly considered timing.</p>\n<p>Below are some ways to get started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To-Do List</h3>\n<p>Seems obvious, but mentioning here regardless! I live by to-do lists. In a collaborative setting, doubly so because it makes sure that everyone is on the same page about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is known and completed</li>\n<li>What is known and not completed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, in seeing and making use of the list, it may prompt the brain to think of other things which should be added to the list. For example, in the last trip after ‚Äòcompleting‚Äô the To-Do list, I noticed that we hadn‚Äôt considered taxi from a train station to a very remote hotel in the evening.</p>\n<h3>What‚Äôs Booked Metadata</h3>\n<p>This can be flight, car, train, hotel, and all sorts of other reference information. Keep the information for reference if you believe you will need it when you arrive at the place which may require the information. A few pointers before adding the information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you really need the sensitive information in the collaboration tool?</strong> Some providers don‚Äôt really need this information anymore, and you can communicate with them directly via mobile apps instead of having to keep track of reference or booking numbers.</li>\n<li><strong>Make sure that the collaboration tool is secure</strong>, where only contributors involved in the trip can reference the information. Do your research to see if the tool is secure enough for your purposes. Not sure? Don‚Äôt store your information in the tool. ‚ú®</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Open Questions</h3>","frontmatter":{"title":"2019 UK Trip! üöÄ","date":"March 03, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019_uk_trip/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/bullet-journaling/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Bullet-Journaling"}},"next":null}}
