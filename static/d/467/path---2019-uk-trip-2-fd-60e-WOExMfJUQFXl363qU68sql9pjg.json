The idea‚Ä¶","html":"<p>As you may have seen from recent tweets, Jer and I recently took a trip to the UK - London, then Scotland, then back to London. </p>\n<p>The idea for the trip was kicked off when reflecting upon going to Maui for my birthday last year. It was an incredible experience, and I wanted to be able to reciprocate for Jer by taking him to the top locations on his ‚Äúbucket list‚Äù.</p>\n<h2>So now that there‚Äôs a location in mind, how the heck to begin planning? ü§î</h2>\n<h3>Collaboration Tools Make It Happen!</h3>\n<p>If you are planning a trip with anyone, you‚Äôre gonna need a collaboration tool which you can collectively reference what needs to be planned, what‚Äôs already been considered and booked, as well as a common reference place for information - hotel names and addresses, booking reference numbers, etc.</p>\n<p>These tools can look anything like the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keybase</li>\n<li>Google Drive</li>\n<li>Git(hu|la)b</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these can be fine choices, but the important bit is that everyone involved in the planning should enjoy using the tool, and the tool should have some security-mindedness (ACLs, etc.) so that if you opt to include sensitive information, this information is kept safe.</p>\n<p>Below I‚Äôll go through the detail concerning all the bits and bobs I find to be handy in this common collaboration space.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>For us, doing touristy stuff doesn‚Äôt rank highly on the list, so we don‚Äôt need to manage every hour of the day with markers of all those little events.</p>\n<p>That said, it still makes sense when planning a trip (especially one with with multiple locations involved) to have a timeline of events at easy reach. Even if you think you may have a ‚Äúsimple trip‚Äù, having a timeline will help tease all sorts of shapes/sizes of logistics to consider and resolve: Timings between the transportation, flights, hotel, meals. </p>\n<p>Through the creation of your own timeline you may realize that by booking that morning flight that you have cheated yourself out of a decent breakfast at the hotel because the times are out of band. You may be arriving so late in the evening that unless you call the hotel and schedule a late-checkin ahead of time, no one will be available to give you a room key. While doing this will take a bit of time up-front, this will ultimately save you the time, anxiety, and headache of having to deal with the fallout of a poorly considered timing.</p>\n<h3>Metadata on What‚Äôs Booked</h3>\n<h3>To-Do List</h3>\n<h3>Open Questions</h3>","frontmatter":{"title":"2019 UK Trip! üöÄ","date":"March 03, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019_uk_trip/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/bullet-journaling/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Bullet-Journaling"}},"next":null}}
