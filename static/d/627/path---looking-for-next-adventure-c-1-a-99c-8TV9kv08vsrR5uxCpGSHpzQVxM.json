I hope this format will prove useful for folks who want to know a little bit more about me than what’s contained within my resume.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#When\">When</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Where\">Where</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#About-Me\">About me</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#what-im-looking-for\">What I’m looking for</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#location\">Location</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#working-hours\">Working Hours</a></li>\n<li>Size</li>\n<li>Type of work</li>\n<li>Culture</li>\n<li>Extras</li>\n<li>Pros</li>\n<li>Cons</li>\n<li>Dealbreakers</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Contact me</li>\n<li>FAQs</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a id=\"When\">⌚️ When</a></h2>\n<p>While I am actively engaging in interview discussions beginning <strong>now</strong>, please be aware that <strong>my preferred earliest start date is Monday, August 1st</strong>, and my latest preferred start date is Monday, October 3rd. </p>\n<p>That said, if your preferred start date for an open role is earlier than this time frame, I am open to the discussion regarding an earlier start date. Let’s chat!</p>\n<h2><a id=\"Where\">🌎 Where</a></h2>\n<p>I live in Seattle, WA. I am exclusively looking to join remote / distributed-first organizations.  </p>\n<p>While I am open to work travel once the COVID-19 pandemic is over, at this current time I will not be open to travel. Alternatively, I am happy to attend any organizational events remotely.</p>\n<p>I deeply miss collaborating with colleagues in in-person settings (summits, off-site events, etc.), and I am looking forward to a future where it is safe to return to this type of collaboration.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"About-Me\">👩🏻‍🎤 About Me</a></h2>\n<p>If you are looking for high-level information about my professional experience, please refer to <a href=\"/brenna-flood-resume-eba585b180a362f5be6de20af6014d04.pdf\">my resume</a> or <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brennaflood\" target=new>LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"what-im-looking-for\">🔎 What I’m looking for</a></h2>\n<p>In my next adventure, I am looking for an organization that cares about the following things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People</li>\n<li>Flexibility and Sustainability</li>\n<li>Clear Mission and Net Positive Good for Community</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a id=\"location\">Location</a></h3>\n<p>It doesn’t matter much to me where the company HQ is, as long as the People team can support US, Bermuda, or Canada-based employees (taxes, benefits, etc.) as I am potentially moving later this year or early next year.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"working-hours\">Working Hours </a></h3>\n<p>My preferred working hours are between 9AM - 5PM Pacific, with room for flexibility to tend to the normal day-to-day things: Have lunch, get exercise, or step away for a walk to reflect so that I can make the best, forward-thinking, creative solutions in support of my colleagues. </p>\n<h3>Size</h3>\n<p>My ideal organization size is between 50 and 250 employees, where I am managing 6 - 15 people (managing ICs or managing managers). I am very comfortable managing at this level and will remain happy managing at this level for the forseeable future.</p>\n<p>If this company size doesn’t fit your org, I may still be open to speaking with you about roles if you are in a place where there’s sprawl and complexity, you have identified at an org level that change is needed, and you intend to hire someone with the budget and latitude to make changes happen. I have a proven track record across my career to be able not only evaluate areas of change, but also fulfilling the commitment of making changes happen in support of reduced technical complexity and tool cost reduction (while documenting and standardizing along the way).</p>\n<center>\n<p><img src=\"/i-love-mess-32e344afd75213be1b8dfea84943f193.gif\" alt=\"I love mess.\"></p>\n</center>\n<h3>Type of Work</h3>\n<h3>Culture</h3>\n<h3>Extras</h3>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<h3>Dealbreakers</h3>\n<h2>Contact me</h2>\n<h2>🌯 In Conclusion…</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"🔭  Looking Ahead Towards the Next Adventure","date":"May 19, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/looking-for-next-adventure/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Switch_Elgato_Twitch_Setup/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Setting up Nintendo Switch with Elgato HD60S For Twitch Streaming"}},"next":null}}
