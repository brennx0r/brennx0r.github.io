Let‚Äôs chat!</p>\n<h2><a id=\"Where\">üåé Where</a></h2>\n<p>I live in Seattle, WA. I am exclusively looking to join remote / distributed-first organizations.  </p>\n<p>While I am open to work travel once the COVID-19 pandemic is over, at this current time I will not be open to travel. Alternatively, I am happy to attend any organizational events remotely.</p>\n<p>I deeply miss collaborating with colleagues in in-person settings (summits, off-site events, etc.), and I am looking forward to a future where it is safe to return to this type of collaboration.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"About-Me\">üë©üèª‚Äçüé§ About Me</a></h2>\n<p>If you are looking for high-level information about my professional experience, please refer to <a href=\"/brenna-flood-resume-eba585b180a362f5be6de20af6014d04.pdf\">my resume</a> or <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brennaflood\" target=new>LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been in tech industry for over 20 years, beginning with an entry-level support role, learning as I progressed over a landscape of different interests, mastering each and moving towards my passions: Technical Support, Systems Engineering, Software Quality Assurance, Build and Release Engineering, and Production Engineering / SRE. Everything I‚Äôve learned about the industry - technologies, processes, and procedures - has all been self-taught: Exploration through reading, attending conferences, hands-on learning, talking to field experts, and attending specific trainings.</p>\n<p>I am highly organized, I love building helpful, concise documentation focused on engagement and learning. I care about outcomes. I optimize towards thoughtfulness, then action: Move deliberately and fix things.</p>\n<p>I care very deeply about people, and believe that treating folks with kindness and respect in the workplace should have, at a minimum, equal care and weight as OKRs, KPIs, or other business objectives, as it‚Äôs <strong>people</strong> that complete those business objectives. Hiring is expensive. Teams are immutable. Focus and psychological safety are important to the health of any business.</p>\n<p>I can tell you many tales about wide changes (configuration management, virtualization,emerging technologies, etc.) I‚Äôve seen in the industry over my career, and (probably) why the changes happened. I can tell you all about all the many times and in what ways I‚Äôve broken production, or worked through the pain of multi-hour production deployments, or have reduced cycle time from months to days to hours to minutes, and why those time scales have massive impacts for organizations. I can tell you all about the amazing, smart, incredible people I‚Äôve had the distinct honor and privilege to work with. I can tell you about that one time I made 10+ muppet-style puppets to put on a show with two of my favorite people to send a love letter to our favorite conference talks for one of my favorite programming languages.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"what-im-looking-for\">üîé What I‚Äôm looking for</a></h2>\n<p>In my next adventure, I am looking for an organization that cares about the following things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People</li>\n<li>Flexibility and Sustainability</li>\n<li>Clear Mission and Net Positive Good for Community</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a id=\"location\">üèô Location</a></h3>\n<p>It doesn‚Äôt matter much to me where the company HQ is, as long as the People team can support US, Bermuda, or Canada-based employees (taxes, benefits, etc.) as I am potentially moving later this year or early next year.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"working-hours\">üéπ Working Hours </a></h3>\n<p>My preferred working hours are between 9AM - 5PM Pacific, with room for flexibility to tend to the normal day-to-day things: Have lunch, get exercise, or step away for a walk to reflect so that I can make the best, forward-thinking, creative solutions in support of my colleagues. </p>\n<h3><a id=\"size\">üéö Size</a></h3>\n<p>My ideal organization size is between <strong>50 and 250 employees, where I am managing 6 - 15 people (managing ICs or managing managers)</strong>. I am very comfortable managing at this level and will remain happy managing at this level for the forseeable future.</p>\n<p>If this company size doesn‚Äôt fit your org, I may still be open to speaking with you about roles if you are in a place where there‚Äôs sprawl and complexity, you have identified at an org level that change is needed, and you intend to hire someone with the budget and latitude to make changes happen. I have a proven track record across my career to be able not only evaluate areas of change, but also fulfilling the commitment of making changes happen in support of reduced technical complexity and tool cost reduction (while documenting and standardizing along the way).</p>\n<center>\n<p><img src=\"/i-love-mess-32e344afd75213be1b8dfea84943f193.gif\" alt=\"I love mess.\"></p>\n</center>\n<h3><a id=\"type-of-work\">Type of Work</a></h3>\n<h3><a id=\"culture\">Culture</a></h3>\n<h3><a id=\"extras\">Extras</a></h3>\n<h3><a id=\"pros\">Pros</a></h3>\n<h3><a id=\"cons\">Cons</a></h3>\n<h3><a id=\"dealbreakers\">Dealbreakers</a></h3>\n<h2><a id=\"contact-me\">Contact me</a></h2>\n<h2>üåØ In Conclusion‚Ä¶</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"üî≠  Looking Ahead Towards the Next Adventure","date":"May 19, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/looking-for-next-adventure/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Switch_Elgato_Twitch_Setup/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Setting up Nintendo Switch with Elgato HD60S For Twitch Streaming"}},"next":null}}
