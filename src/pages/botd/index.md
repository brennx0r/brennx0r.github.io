In a Twitter conversation between a couple friends, the topic of 
"Which Belcher are you?" came up. And clearly, I am Bob. Clearly.

This has led to one of the friends in the conversation - @sweetpavement - to
begin to prompt me for a Burger of the Day (BOTD) each weekday as a tweet.

Since this has been going on for longer than a week, I'm finding that an archive
list is now needed to make sure that I'm not repeating puns, and to showcase
this sacriliciousness.
