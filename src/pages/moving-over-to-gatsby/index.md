This is the first post since migrating my personal website from using Middleman to using GatsbyJS + Dimension Starter. ðŸš€

Doing the migration was a whole lot more straightforward than I thought it would be. What made the ease of migration possible was mainly due to the existance of modules, starters, and excellent documentation to help with getting started.

I'm very excited to begin my journey in working more actively with the JavaScript ecosystem. 

Having been rooted in the Ruby community for several years, it's an interesting change of pace to take a peek into what other communities are doing, what the development patterns are, and how folks interact with eachother.
